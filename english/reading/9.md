Now astronomy didn't really bloom into the science it is today until the development of spectroscopy.

spectroscopy

Spectroscopy is basically the study of spectra and spectral lines of light, and specifically for us, the light from stars.
It makes it possible to analyze the light emitted from stars.

When you analyze this light, you can figure out their distance from the earth, and identify what they are made of, determine their chemical composition. 
Before we get into that though, it's probably a good thing to back up a bit.

You all know how when you take a crystal prism and pass a beam of sunlight through it, you get a spectrum,
a beam of sunlight
crystal
prism
a transparent glass or plastic object that separates white light that passes through it into different colours
棱镜

which looks like a continuous band of rainbow colors.
continuous
band
a group of musicians who play modern music together
乐队
a thin, flat piece of cloth, elastic, metal, or other material put around something, or a long, narrow piece of colour, light, etc. that is different from what surrounds it
带，细绳;箍
a group of people who share the same interests or beliefs, or who have joined together for a special purpose
一帮人，一群人，一伙人
to put a band on something, especially an animal
（尤指在动物身上）套环，戴上环套

a band of
用于指代人或动物的集合，如"a band of wolves" 译为“一群狼”。
一个乐队：
特指音乐团体的意思，如"a band of musicians" 译为“一个乐队”。
一队：
指由特定群体组成的一组，如"a band of soldiers" 译为“一队士兵”。
一帮：
用于指代一群人，常带有一些非正式或贬义的色彩，如"a band of thieves" 译为“一帮小偷”。
一带：
当指物理上的带状区域或物品时，如"a band of clouds" 译为“一带云彩”。

The light that we see with our human eyes as a band of rainbow color falls in a range of what's called visible light.

And visible light spectroscopy is probably the most important kind of spectroscopy.
Anyone want to take a stab at the scientific term for visible light?
stab
take a stab at
And I'm sure all of you know this because you all did the reading for today.
Optical radiation.
But I thought being exposed to radiation is dangerous.
radiation

Yes, and no.
If you are talking about radiation, like in the element Uranium, yeah, that's dangerous.
But radiation as a general term actually refers to anything that spreads away from its source.
spreads away
扩散开

So optical radiation is just visible light energy spreading out.
optical
relating to light or the ability to see
光学的;视觉的;视力的
spreading out
If people spread out, they move from being close together in a group to being in different places across a larger area.

spread out
OK, so we've got a spectrum of a beam of sunlight and it looks like the colors bleed into each other.
bleed into each other
beam
a line of light that shines from a bright object
光线;光束;光柱

There are no interruptions, just a band flowing from violet to green, to yellow, to… you get the idea.
interruptions
violet
Well, what happens if the sunlight's spectrum is magnified?
Maybe you all didn't do the reading.
Well, here's what you'd see.
I want you to know this that this spectrum is interrupted by dark lines called spectral lines.

If you really magnify the spectrum of the sunlight, you could identify more than 100,000 of them.
spectrum:
They may look like kind of randomly placed,
randomly placed
but they actually form many distinct patterns.
And if you were looking at the spectrum of some other star, the colors would be the same.
But the spectral lines would break it up at different places, making different patterns.
break it up
Each pattern stands for a distinct chemical element, and so different sets or patterns of spectral lines mean that the star has a different chemical composition.
composition
So how do we know which spectral patterns match up with which elements?
spectral patterns
Well, a kind of spectroscopic library of elements was compiled using flame tests.
compile
A known element, say a piece of iron for example, is heated in a pure gas flame.
The iron eventually heats to the point that it radiates light.
This light is passed through a prism, which breaks it up into a spectrum.
pass through
break up
And a unique pattern, kind of like a chemical fingerprint of spectral lines for that element appears.
This process was repeated over and over again for many different elements,
so we can figure out the chemical makeup of another star by comparing the spectral pattern it has to the pattern of the elements in the library.
chemical makeup
Oh, an interesting story about how one of the elements was discovered through spectroscopy.
There was a pretty extensive library of spectral line patterns of elements even by the 1860s.
A British astronomer was analyzing a spectrograph of sunlight, and he noticed a particular pattern of spectral lines that didn't match anything in the library.
spectrograph

So he put two and two together, and decided there was an element in the sun that hadn'tbeen discovered here on the earth yet.
Any guesses about what that element is?
It actually turned out to be pretty common and I'm sure all of you know it.
pretty
turn out to
OK. Let's try something else.
Any of you happened to be familiar with the Greek word for sun by chance?
happened to be
Something like Helius or something like that.
Oh it must be Helium.
So you are saying that Helium was discovered on the sun first.
Yes, and this is a good example of how important spectroscopy is in astronomy.
