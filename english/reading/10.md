Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class. The class is discussing animal behavior.
FEMALE PROFESSOR: OK, the next kind of animal behavior I want to talk about might be familiar to you. You may have seen, for example, a bird that's in the middle of a mating ritual. And, and suddenly it stops and  --you know, it takes a few moments to straighten its feathers--and then returns to the mating ritual. This kind of behavior-- this doing something that seems completely out of place--is what we call a displacement activity.
ritual
a way of doing something in which the same actions are done in the same way every time
例行公事，老规矩;（尤指）仪式
preens
If a bird preens or preens itself, it cleans and arranges its feathers using its beak.
（鸟）用喙整理（羽毛）
straighten
to spend time making yourself look attractive

精心打扮
displacement
the situation in which people are forced to leave the place where they normally live
被迫移居他乡
the weight of liquid that is forced out of position by an object that is floating on or in it
排水量

out of place
指事物或人处于不恰当的位置或状态，常用于描述不协调、不协调或不合时宜的场景

Displacement activities are activities that animals engage in when they have conflicting drives—if,we take our example from a minute ago—if, if the bird is afraid of its mate, it's conflicted, it wants to mate, but it's also afraid and wants to run away, so instead it starts grooming itself. So the displacement activity, the, the grooming, the straightening of its feathers seems to be an irrelevant behavior.So what do you think another example of a displacement activity might be?
engage

雇用;聘用

MALE STUDENT: How about an animal that, um, instead of fighting its enemy or running away, it attacks a plant or a bush?
FEMALE PROFESSOR: That's a really good suggestion, Carl, but that's called redirecting. The animal is redirecting its behavior to another object, in this case, the plant or the bush. But that's not an irrelevant or inappropriate behavior—the behavior makes sense—it's appropriate under the circumstances, but what doesn't make sense is the object the behavior's directed toward.OK, who else? Carol?
redirecting.
to change the direction of something, especially to send a letter to a new address

enemy
run away

逃避；回避；避免正视

FEMALE STUDENT: I think I read in another class about an experiment, um, where an object that the animal was afraid of was put next to its food—next to the animal's food—and the animal, it was conflicted between confronting the object, and eating the food, so instead it just fell asleep. Like that?
confront
FEMALE PROFESSOR: That's exactly what I mean. Displacement occurs because the animal's got two conflicting drives, two competing urges, in this case, fear and hunger—and what happens is they inhibit each other—they cancel each other out in a way, and a third, seemingly irrelevant behavior surfaces … through a process that we call disinhibition.Now, in disinhibition, the basic idea is that two drives that seem to inhibit, to hold back a third drive.
compete
urges
a strong wish, especially one that is difficult or impossible to control
（尤指难以或无法控制的）欲望，冲动
to strongly advise or try to persuade someone to do a particular thing
敦促;驱策;力劝
inhibit

使…拘谨；使…有顾忌
to slow down a process or the growth of something

（常指因恐惧或不愿让事情变得更糟而）退缩，不做

cancel out
to remove the effect of one thing by doing another thing that has the opposite effect
抵消；对消
Or well, they get in the way of each other in a, in a conflict situation, and somehow lose control, lose their inhibiting effect on that third behavior…wh-which means that the third drive surfaces...it-it's expressed in the animal's behavior.Now, these displacement activities can include feeding, drinking, grooming, even sleeping. These are what we call "comfort behaviors." So why do you think displacement activities are so often comfort behaviors, such as grooming?
MALE STUDENT: Maybe because it's easy for them to do—I mean, grooming is like one of the most accessible things an animal can do—it's something they do all the time, and they have the–the stimulus right there, on the outside of their bodies in order to do the grooming—or if food is right in front of them. Basically, they don't have to think very much about those behaviors.

outside
FEMALE STUDENT: Professor, isn't it possible that animals groom because they've gotten messed up a little from fighting or mating? I mean, if a bird's feathers get ruffled, or an animal's fur—maybe it's not so strange for them to stop and tidy themselves up at that point.
FEMALE PROFESSOR: That's another possible reason, although it doesn't necessarily explain other behaviors such as eating, drinking, or sleeping. What's interesting is that studies have been done that suggest that the animal's environment may play a part in determining what kind of behavior it displays.
mess up, tidy up, ruffled
have gotten 
For example, there's a bird–the wood thrush, anyway when the wood thrush is in an attack-escape conflict—that is, it's caught between the two urges to escape from or attack an enemy—if it's sitting on a horizontal branch, it'll wipe its beak on its perch. If it's sitting on a vertical branch, it, um, will groom its breast feathers. The immediate environment of the bird—its immediate, um, its relationship to its immediate environment seems to play a part in which behavior it will display.
