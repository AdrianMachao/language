Narrator: Now listen to two students discussing the article.
Man: Did you see this article about the library soon?
Woman: Yeah, I think it's about time they did something like that.
Man: Oh yeah?
Woman: Yeah, I worked at the library last year.
Man: Yeah. I remember that you were shelving books or something, right?
Woman: Right. And I have to say that the shelves were all getting pretty crowded, pretty packed with books. The librarians complained about it a lot actually.
Man: There was actually a problem?
Woman: Yeah in fact. There were piles of books stacked in some of the librarian’s offices, new shipments of books that the university had bought. But we didn't have room for them, so they didn't go out on the shelves right away, which is kind of a shame since someone might have been able to use them.
Man: This seems like a practical move then.
Woman: Yeah, and it's a great idea to give us online access. I actually think students will find it easier to use these books now, because you won't have to go to the library or carry those books around. You could just sit in your dorm room and read.
Man: That's true.
Woman: I kind of wish they do it with all the books. To be honest, it would make things a lot easier.
Man: Well, maybe someday.
