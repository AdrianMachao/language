outdoor or indoor activities
indoor
I prefer indoor sports due to various reasons. First, working out indoors wouldn't be affected by the weather. For example, I can have fun playing badminton, it doesn’t matter even if it rains cats and dogs outside. During summer days that are sweltering hot, we can exercise indoors without getting sun burnt. Second, indoor activities are usually, if not always, less intense. That means we don’t get easily injured comparing to doing outdoor sports like skiing or snowboarding. Indoor sports like yoga are more soothing, or relaxing.
