Narrator: Now, listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class.
Scientists did an experiment that demonstrated how this works. The study used long white lab coats, just like medical doctors wear here in the U.S.
Now, what traits do we associate with doctors? For one thing, we know they're observant, they need to pay attention to detail.
So, researchers wanted to see if people who weren't medical doctors would show this behavior while wearing lab coats. Here's what they did.
They got 2 groups of volunteers. In one of the groups, each of the volunteers was given a lab coat to wear.
In the other group, each volunteer was just shown a lab coat. It was put on the table in front of them and they were told to look at it.
In each case, the volunteers were told that these were doctors' lab coats. To test their abilities, the volunteers had to look at two pictures that were almost the same, but not quite.
Then the participants had to see how many differences they could notice between the two pictures. Here's the interesting thing.
The people who were wearing doctor's lab coats noticed more differences than the people who just looked at the lab coats.
So, the researchers concluded that by actually wearing the lab coats, people started to act like doctors—to be more observant and better at noticing small details.
