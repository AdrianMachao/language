I agree with this the statement because it's flexibly that students should be allowed to take additional classes each semester in order to earn their degrees more quickly, as it offers students and institution flexibility for diverse learning paces (revised for clarity) and also reduces the financial burden from students.

One supporting example is a highly motivated student who can carry handle a heavy workload workload; they can graduate sooner (revised for natural flow) and enter the workforce.
