Some college students prefer to have class during the day and work in the evenings or on weekends. Others prefer to have classed in evenings or on weekends and work during the day, which do you think is better?
I Prefer to have classed during the day and work in the evenings or on weekends. First, being available during the day make it easy to contact others, the convenience of face-to-face discussions and interactions leads to high efficiency. Second, working in the evening or on weekends enables us to be more focused on reviewing the content learned during the day, resulting in a better unstanding of the subject matter.
