During our last movie night, I watched a historical drama with two friends. One of my friend is a history fan, and he noticed some historical mistakes in the film that bother him. That's why he wasn't thrilled with the film. one the other hand, another friend is quite artistic, and she loved the movie because she focused on things like the visual style and creativity. It was fanscinating to see their diverse opionions and learn from each other's perspectives.

I was watching a movie last weekend. I thought it would be a greate experience, but it turned out to be a bit disappointing. I was watching Harry Potter with some friends in my living room. and they just couldn't resist chatting and making comment about everything throught the entire 2 hours. While it meant to be a fun social activity, I found it really distracting because I couldn't keep up with their conversation while following the movie's storyline. It was nearly impossible to immerse myself into the film and truly enjoy it.
