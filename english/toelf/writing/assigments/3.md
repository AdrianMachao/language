I think the government should cut expenses in the number of government staff.
First of all, with the development of society, many complicated processes have been simplified and integrated into just one or two steps.
For example, in the past, If someone wanted to start a bakery business, they had to apply for various licenses from different departments, such as a business permit and a health license, which was a time-consuming and energy-draining process.

Now, the government offers a streamlined licensing process, allowing us to get these licenses through a single process instead of applying for each one separately. As a result, the government can run effectively with a smaller workforce. 【前面细节/例子的应用和逻辑展开非常好】

In addition, the adoption of advanced technologies has enabled most processes that previously required handling in-person to be moved online. Consequently, fewer staff are needed to maintain these digital systems and manage office work. A prime example is "Suishenban", shanghai's one-stop platform for government services, enabling us to access most of the government's services online. 
Through this APP, I often check my social security information and have previously applied for my residence card, which brings me great convenience. In conclusion, since the government can now provide services with minimal staff，it is advisable to cut expenses by cutting the number of government staff.

Hi 马同学，这篇分论点和论据细节的展开都非常不错，语言发挥也很好，非常不错！
有个别语言细节可以再修改下，此外也可以额外点明在人员上削减开支：
- 因为你写到的两个原因，所以非常可行
- 削减开支效果显著
