I believe that the use of automation is a positive development overall. First of all, automation brings about beneficial changed in society. 
This is because it can replace people performing dangerous work, protecting human lives and improving safety. For example, underwater tasks are often conducted under extremely high pressure and other harsh conditions, making it impossible and unsafe for humans to finish it.

harsh conditions

With Automation, people can remotely control robots to complete such heavy and risky work. This approach not only reduce workplace injuries but also promotes human well-being. Automation has become so integral to our lives that it is now indispensable.
integral:构成整体所必需的
indispensable:必不可少的，必需的

In addition, Although the initial setup cost of automation can be high for many companies or governments, its long-term benefits are significant and continue to grow.

As the technology develops, it is already having a huge impact on various areas. First, the automation industry has created many new job opportunities in areas like data analysis and programming, which contributes to reduce unemployment rates and improve living standards.

Second, Automation systems are more accurate and swift than humans and can work around the clock, enabling people to work more efficiently and comfortably. In conclusion, I firmly think that utilizing automation is a positive trend.
swift:迅速的，敏捷的，快的

- 带来的新工作岗位为什么比之前的更好？

- 更高效、可以全天候工作还可以有什么好处？
