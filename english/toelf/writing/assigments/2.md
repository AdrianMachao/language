I believe that it is more effective to have ordinary people talk about a product. 
First of all, using ordinary people for endorsement can be much less expensive than hiring a celebrity. Many companies have a limited budget that can be better allocated to other valuable fields such as product research and employee compensation. Product quality is so crucial and significant for a company that the company should invest resources in maintaining and improving it. If a company uses celebrity endorsement but neglects the quality of the product, it might grab costumers' attention quickly in the short term, but eventually damage its brand image and lose out to competitors.

In addition, ordinary people's opinions are more trustworthy. Since ordinary people can share the real experiences and practical use of the product, providing valuable information to the potential buyers. In general, ordinary people's reviews are typically regarded as a key factor in determining consumers' purchasing decisions. In contrast, it is possible that celebrity has never actually used the product, making the product seem untrustworthy. Moreover, a product that looks perfect on a celebrity may not necessarily fit the average consumer.
In conclusion, I prefer to have ordinary people talk about the product.

Hello 马同学，这一篇的三个角度都很好，第一个和第二个的角度拓展是相当充分的；如果有时间的话，第二个角度还可以再多写一些，比如为什么普通人更有可能使用过广告中的产品，而名人很可能只是代言而并没有实际的使用经历？有没有比较典型的原因和例子？如果要写最后一点的话，需要再拓展一下；如果时间不够的话，也可以删掉最后一点
这篇语言小错误稍微多一点，可以继续精益求精喔
