# AI
## advantages
From my perspective, AI contributes positively to our socity. Unlike humans, machine have the potenial to work around the clock without a break, leading to continuous service or production.

It seems to me that AI has brought about negative differences in our socity. It is because AI systems often need enormous amount of data, which may lead to privacy issues.
issue = problem
privacy issues: names, addresses, preferences,school, daily routines, family members
sales calls(annoying),scam emails


I think AI has made a positivie difference in our socity. It can analyze data and identify patterns to provide personalized information, enhancing user experiences in areas like entertainment.
pattern=interests and hobbies=routine=habits
movie genres, television series, games
## disadvantage
Personally, I regard AI as a harmful force within socity as automation could replace human jobs in certain fields, such as customer service. This may lead to an increase of unemplyment rate.

I think AI has made a bad impact on society. This is mainly because AI and robots lack the ability to understand human emotions, which can lead to misunderstandings.
misunderstandings = disappointment = frustraion = worse situations
